## 🌐 My Web3 Journey

I'm currently working on an academic project focused on writing an educational book that introduces blockchain concepts in a simple and accessible way.  
In addition, I'm taking a **mini-course on Solidity** offered by **Eth Kipu**, where I'm learning the basics of smart contract development and deployment on the Ethereum network.

Through my studies and personal projects, I'm gradually building a foundation to become a capable and responsible developer within the Web3 ecosystem.
